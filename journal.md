#11/28/17
Updated my slides

#11/30/17
Code to tokenize, pull out imports, analyze 'name' lines in code

#1/16/18
Fixed code to pull in right arguements for methods

#1/23/18
Fixed code and researched online into Java documentation

#2/27/18
Fixed organization the code into methods, and organized the lines inside of methods. Also verbalized the documentation for importing packages into misc_documentation, which is overall code documentation and not tied to a specific method. Moreover, made my foo2 sample code more complicated for testing purposes.

#To do
Conduct analysis by looking at relationships (see which methods call each other)
